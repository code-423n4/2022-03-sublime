Hey all, to compile our contracts please run `dapp build` after installing dapp.tools. We missed adding this to our README


[03/29/2022 11:53 AM] 3bagsFull#1604
Hi, @Ritik | Sublime ,  just want to double check on the right branch. I can't find any code in the C4 repo only links to the code in README. The branch name linked to is 46536a6d25. Is this right?


[03/29/2022 1:10 PM] Ritik#1677
Hey @kyliek, yes, the commit used is 46536a6.

the repo at this commit is: https://github.com/sublime-finance/sublime-v1/tree/46536a6d25df4264c1b217bd3232af30355dcb95

Hi, the commit you've listed above doesn't have any of the tests found on master. This makes it much harder to write a PoC in code as we can't piggy back off of the existing test harness/suite. Could you update the branch `0.0.7` tag to include the tests please? (I'll have to describe a PoC step-by-step in the meantime)

under what circumstances will termination be invoked? also, an explanation of what it's intended behaviour is would be great


[03/30/2022 5:55 AM] Ritik#1677
Hi @dirk_y, unfortunately the contract changed slightly on the last day, but the tests couldn't be modified to meet those changes in time for the contest. In order to not confuse people we decided it was best to remove the tests from the final release


[03/30/2022 5:58 AM] Ritik#1677
Termination might be executed in case of malicious activities. For eg, suppose a borrower turns out to have impersonated (or taken over) another account and a verifier wrongly verifies them, the loan can be terminated and collateral repossessed


[03/30/2022 6:04 AM] Ritik#1677
to add to this, once the collateral is transferred, after reconfirmation that there indeed was something wrong, the collateral that was transferred would then be redistributed amongst the lenders of the loan proportionately


[03/30/2022 6:16 AM] hickuphh3
ok got it, thanks!

Hi Sublime team, what would be a good general value for idealCollateralRatio?


[03/31/2022 1:07 PM] Ritik#1677
hey, sorry, I missed this. idealCollateralRatio is (ideally) supposed to work for all general values, starting from 0


[03/31/2022 1:08 PM] 0xdjango
Got it, thanks
